# Wave Analyzer

This is a wave analyzer created as the BCIT COMP 3931 Final Project. This application makes use of audio fundamentals to analyze .wav files for the frequencies involved and threading to improve performance.

## Installation

This application has been developed in Microsoft Visual Studio.

## Usage

Open a .wav file, or record your own audio with this application for analysis. If your own audio has been recorded, you may also save it as a .wav file.

Scroll to zoom in/out. The graph area can be highlighted to select a certain portion of the graph for analysis.

The multithreaded version and the sync version of the functions are there to showcase the time savings of using multithreading. Please run each individually to see the results.

The inverse (i) version of functions reverses the effects of the forward versions.
